Welcome to my website. It’s currently in its early stages and hopefully will become more detailed with time.
My name is Adnan, I’m a 4th year integrated Masters Physics and Computer Science student at Durham University. 
Currently I use this site to share blog posts about my various technical projects. 
They are on the main page, and ordered by category via the sidebar.
