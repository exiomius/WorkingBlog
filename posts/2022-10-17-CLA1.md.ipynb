    "Because machine learning is largely about manipulating data, and almost all data can be represented as a matrix, understanding linear algebra is often cited as a prerequisite to reading and understanding formal mathematical descriptions of machine learning methods, as well as creating or editing existing methods. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Linear Algebra is a fast.ai course covering linear algebra to be centered around practical applications and algorithms. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main areas for machine learning in which some linear algebra knowledge can help:\n",
    "- Speed (how fast matrix multiplication occurs)\n",
    "- Accuracy (how accurately can computers represent numbers)\n",
    "- Memory Usage (how to efficiently store matrices)\n",
    "- Scalability (how to use more data than you have the memory to store)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we are interested in these things is because often the bottleneck to a machine learning algorithm is within these four areas. In other words, knowledge in these areas can be the difference between a great ML approach and an unusable one. One example is in the case of how CNNs create their convolutional layers. While there are many mathematically equivalently orders in which to create these layers, some are evidently significantly faster. When these are applied in bulk, the optimisation makes all the difference. So in order to design or edit algorithms for usage in ML, knowledge in computational linear algebra is essential, particularly in research contexts as new approaches have not yet been optimised or implemented in existing frameworks."
