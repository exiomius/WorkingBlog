    "# What is overworking? \n",
    "Overworking is expending too much time and energy on work that your brain and body slow down. This has effects on your productivity and happiness, and is not optimal for either. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-Linear relationship\n",
    "In the past, humans often did 'non-brainy' tasks for work. Imagine working at a factory. Hours spent working is roughly proportional to units created. If working for one hour produces 10 items, then working for five hours produces 50. However, in modern life, especially as a student, most of not all of our work is not non-brainy, in fact, it's the complete opposite. This linear relationship between hours spent working at a desk and productivity loses it's feasibility. \n",

    "# Why is overworking detrimental to productivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are overworked, many of your cognitive faculties lose their sharpness. Sure physically you get tired, which is more obvious, but cognitive faculties like emotional regulation, creative thought, self-esteem etc most often take a plunge as your mental health declines as you continue to overwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creative thought decline, and its severe consequences on productivity, is often overlooked as a result of overworking. Intuitively, the tasks we are required to do will be done better if new ideas flow and are refined. Coding is a good example, a great programmer will implement fresh, creative, and inspiring ideas in their work. But there's also a less intuitive consequence. Creativity doesn't just improve things directly relating to the subject matter, but outside and around it. You need creativity, flexible thought, in order to effectively prioritise what work to do, and how to function efficiently. \n",

    "How to learn and efficeintly\n",
    "\n",
    "Hrs worked is capped, but knowledge chosen to attain, and ability to learn in more efficeint ways, to divide your energy correctly, is not. Thinking about whats important to learn and why. If you're dead overworked at a desk you only have the capacity to do what is in front of you, not think about why, the context of the broader picture, and make dynamic connections between topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "like learning what actually matters in writing an email. socially how much it matters to write parts or length. or when youll meet them next etc. you can learn and train these skills to be able to do it instantly and write an unnceasry lengthy or detailed email that woudl take 30 mins in 10\n",
    "\n",
    "i thought i was all out of options with meds when i was overworekd. no fresh ideas came. i thought i was at my ends. but in reality that wasnt the case. calming down properly and talking it through with a friend, i realised there were still like 5 things i would try and if i stayed fleixble and calm and not overworked, these ideas wouldve came naturally, and would contue to have\n",

    "overworked on the tipping point. what if you get ill? being behind or struggling is a state of mind, one that overworking perpuates. you might very well be ojectibity behind sure to some measure, but having that feeling of being behind crushing you will crush your proxcucirtty\n",

The overworking might not appear blantantly deterimental to phys because of all the experience he has with it, but it does in new fields. ever wondered why a really smart person seemingly does something inefficient? \n",

    "\"At the same time it's also creative. You've written a program that gets a job done, but it's 300 lines of code, it took you 3 weeks to write it, and you've already started to forget how parts of it work. How are you going to make it easier to work with? You need to break it down into pieces. It needs to tell a story. When someone else reads it, they should be able to follow the logical flow. There's no recipe for doing that perfectly - it involves a lot of creativity, and creating structure out of chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also involves psychology. Somebody tells you what they want the software to do. It might be a user, a customer, a designer - someone less technical than you. Your job is to figure out how to translate their need, into an actual requirement. To do that you need to get into their head and figure out what they actually want, and then figure out how to achieve that given the technical limitations of what's possible.\n",

At night, I can be wide eyed awake and if I do it properly for 15 and focus on relaxing my body I can get my mouth to deeply yawn like 10 times and sleep like a baby\n",
    "\n",
    "im experimenting with NSDR (non sleep deep rest) techniques which are like naps but more consistent and reliable to increase energy, concentation, decrease fatigue, stress buildup, improve neuroplasticity (learning) and work longer more concentrated hours. so far it's been working quite well! Methods to force your body to rest properly to decrease stress, let ideas flow, improve mood and improve concentration both daily and over time\n",
    "\n",
    "afaik right now you can pull extra working hours for about 3 weeks for a short productivity increase, but afterwards there will be an unavoidable productivity decrease for a few weeks. In a more general sense, if you overwork your brain over time then it is going to demand an unavoidable productivity decreases for a few weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not just about your brain being tired for concentration, but your mental health plummets and so does your happiness and ability to think flexibly. You can't think clearly about what to do next if you are too stressed out or tired, and often that thinking clearly a little ahead saves so much time in efficiency. If you're too stressed out or tired, your brain finds it harder to create key connections between concepts in say physics. Good Ideas themselves are rarer to occur. Ideas often come in reason times like in the shower or at night in bed or on a walk because they occur when your brain is in a diffused relaxed ish mode of thinking. Working for long hours kills this ability and kills creativity over time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing is working longer gives more productivity in the short term yeah, like studying an extra hour at the end of a day, but over time it will tire your brain out so what normally takes 6 hours to do takes 7. Most of the work we do nowadays is incredibly dependent on how well we can concentrate and we forget this. Concentrating well for 2 hours on programming can outdo productivity of concentrating awfully for 5 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "looking at some scientific research on productivity, its too complicated and depends on the job too much to make a blanket number, but for medium problem solving work like coding, probably 35-40 hrs max, learning more towards 35. For intense problem solving like pure maths, i recall Newton famously only studied for like 4 hours a day, maybe there's some truth to that. A friend at uni worked at bank of america last summer and he said he would work like 8-10 hours a day, but at uni studying a maths degree he could do less than half of that\n",
